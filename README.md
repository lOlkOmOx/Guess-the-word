# Guess-the-word

Guess the Word is a game where the goal is to find a hidden 5-letter English word. The user has 6 attempts, and after each guess, the letters change color depending on their accuracy: green if the letter is in the correct position, yellow if the letter is in the word but in a different position, and no color if the letter is not in the word. This app uses an open-source API to fetch random English words: `https://api.datamuse.com/`.
